				<div class="big_style">Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows.</div>
				</div>
			<div class="big_style_p"><p>Netflix, Inc. is a pay television over-the-top media service and American production company that offers subscription-based video on demand from a library of films and television series, 40% of which is original programming produced in-house. As of October 2021, Netflix has over 214 million subscribers, including 74 million in the United States and Canada, 70 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 39 million in Latin America, and 30 million in Asia-Pacific.[10][11] It is available worldwide except in mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to US sanctions). Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution, and is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

Netflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[18][19] In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content production industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards.

The company is ranked 164th on the Fortune 500[20] and 284th on the Forbes Global 2000.[21] It is the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization.[22] In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[23] During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%</div>
